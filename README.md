![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT%20License-purple)

## Description

This project aims to enhance a fully functioning Tech Quiz application by implementing Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing. The app, built using the MERN stack, allows users to take a tech quiz consisting of random questions. The objective of this project is to ensure the robustness of the application through automated testing, validating the functionality of the quiz, and ensuring consistent performance during user interactions.
